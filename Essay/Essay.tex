    Kevin Systrom was born on the 30th December 1983 in Hooliston, Massachusetts. He is 
    an American entrepeneur and Software Engineer. He is best known for creating the monumentally
    popular social media and photo sharing app; Instagram along with his co-founder Mike Krieger. With an estimated net
    worth if \$1.4 Billion, he is included on the list of America's wealthiest individuals under 40.

    Systrom studied Management Science and Engineering in Stanford University 
    where he would later graudate with a Bacelors degree. He spent his third year abroad in Florence, Italy.
    During his time abroa, he studied photography, which would prove to be useful in the future as his deep understaning of photos
    was a major driving force for the intense popularity and user adoption of Instagram.

    During his time in University, he also got his very first taste of entrepeneurship 
    and startups when he was nominated to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program. 
    The fellowship led to an internship at a company called Odeo, which interestingly enough
    would graduate to become the social media platform we know today; Twitter.
