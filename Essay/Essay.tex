    \newpage

    Kevin Systrom was born on the 30th December 1983 in Hooliston, Massachusetts. He is 
    an American entrepeneur and Software Engineer. He is best known for creating the monumentally
    popular social media and photo sharing app: Instagram along with his co-founder Mike Krieger. With an estimated net
    worth if \$1.4 Billion, he is included on the list of America's wealthiest individuals under 40.

    Systrom studied Management Science and Engineering in Stanford University 
    where he would later graudate with a Bacelors degree. He spent his third year abroad in Florence, Italy.
    During his time abroad, he studied photography, which would prove to be useful in the future as his deep understanding of photos
    was a major driving force for the intense popularity and user adoption of Instagram.

    While in university, 
    he also got his very first taste of entrepeneurship 
    and startups when he was nominated to participate in the Mayfield Fellows Program. 
    The fellowship led to an internship at a company called Odeo, a podcasting app. The creator of Odeo
    would later go on to create Twitter, interestingly enough Jack Dorsey, the current CEO of Twitter, 
    was also working at Odeo at the same time as Systrom.

    Systrom's desire to become an entrepreneur
    and start his own business started when he was working at Google early in his career. He worked on many google services such as Gmail and Google's own
    Document Suite(Docs, Spreadsheets) etc. He was employed at Google for a total of two years before finally quitting
    due to frustrations of not being promoted to an Associate Product Manager position.

    \section{What changed?, Motivations}
    After his exit from Google he joined a social travel recommendation startup called 
    NextStop. NextStop mixed elements of social recommendations with
    with a reputation system and gameplay. It was bought by Facebook a year after its inception.
